Users can enter their health data manually or use integrated devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers).
Alerts for critical health conditions (e.g., high blood pressure).
Community features that encourage health challenges or provide local health tips.
Health resources like nearby clinics or healthcare professionals.
Option to share data with local doctors or health centers for better personalized care.
Impact:

Increases community awareness about health.
Helps reduce the burden on healthcare systems by focusing on prevention and early diagnosis.
Promotes healthy living and better management of chronic diseases.
Builds a stronger connection between individuals and local healthcare providers.
